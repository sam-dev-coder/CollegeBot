# CollegeBot: A Student-Centric Chatbot with Natural Language Capabilities

This repository contains the code and data for a chatbot project I co-developed with five other developers. The goal of the project was to create a chatbot that could answer various college-related queries with natural language understanding and generation techniques.

## Chatbot

The chatbot, named CollegeBot, was designed to provide information about various college-related topics, such as courses, fees, admission process, faculty, and events. The chatbot was able to handle complex queries that required multiple steps, such as filling an application form, booking an appointment, or registering for an event. The chatbot was also able to maintain the context and flow of the conversation, and provide natural and engaging responses.

## Framework

The framework used for this project was Rasa, an open-source framework for building conversational AI applications. Rasa provided the tools and components for natural language understanding, dialogue management, and natural language generation. The framework was also scalable, customizable, and easy to integrate with other services and platforms.

## Data

The data used for this project was obtained from various sources, such as the college website, the college brochure, and the college FAQs. The data contained information about the college's courses, fees, admission process, faculty, and events. The data was cleaned, preprocessed, and annotated using Rasa NLU format.

## Model

The model used for this project was a combination of Rasa NLU and Rasa Core. Rasa NLU was used to parse user queries and extract relevant information, such as intents and entities. Rasa Core was used to manage the dialogue state and select the appropriate actions and responses. The model was trained and tuned using Rasa CLI and Rasa X.

## Evaluation

The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy. The model was also tested using Rasa X, an interactive tool that allowed us to collect user feedback and improve the chatbot's performance and usability.

## Results and Demo

The results and demo of the project were presented to the college authorities and the potential users. The results showed the chatbot's capabilities, the features, and the benefits. The demo showed the chatbot's functionality and user-friendliness. The project received positive feedback and appreciation from the college authorities and the potential users.
